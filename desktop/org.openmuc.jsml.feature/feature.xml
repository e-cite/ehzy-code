      jSML is Java library implementing the Smart Message Language (SML).
SML is communication protocol for transmitting meter data for so called smart meters.  SML is similar to XML with regard to its ability to nest information tags within other tags.  But the standard way of coding SML packets is in a more efficient binary format that is similar but not equal to BER encoding. Also the specification comes in a form that is similar to ASN.1 but not completely standards compliant.
The jSML library can be used to easily construct SML messages, encode them, and then send them. Just as easily received messages can be decoded. jSML implements the SML Transport Layers necessary to communicate over TCP/IP and serial connections. View the sample files for more details.
